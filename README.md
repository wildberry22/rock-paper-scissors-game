## Gameplay and Rules

Rock paper scissors is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with a hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).

The player has to pick one of the options by clicking on the text. Upon clicking, the computer makes its choice, and the result of the round can be seen immediately on screen.

The winner of the game is determined by a set of rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and played again.
